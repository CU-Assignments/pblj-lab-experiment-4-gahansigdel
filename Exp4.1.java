Experiment 4.1: Employee Management System

The Employee Management System is a simple Java-based application that uses ArrayList to manage employee records. The system allows users to perform the following operations:

Add Employee → Store Employee ID, Name, and Salary.

Update Employee → Modify employee details based on their ID.

Remove Employee → Delete an employee using their ID.

Search Employee → Find employees by ID or Name.

Display All Employees → Show a complete list of employees.

Test Cases

Test Case 1: Adding Employees (No Employees Initially)
Display Employees
Expected Output:
No employees found.
  
Test Case 2: Add Employees
Input:
Add Employee (ID=101, Name="Anish", Salary=50000)
Add Employee (ID=102, Name="Bobby", Salary=60000)
Expected Output:
Employee Added: ID=101, Name=Anish, Salary=50000
Employee Added: ID=102, Name=Bobby, Salary=60000

Test Case 3: Update Employee Salary
Input:
Update Employee (ID=101, New Salary=55000)
Expected Output:
Employee ID 101 updated successfully.

Test Case 4: Search Employee by ID
Input:
Search Employee by ID=102
Expected Output:
Employee Found: ID=102, Name=Bobby, Salary=60000

Test Case 5: Remove Employee
Input:
Remove Employee (ID=101)
Expected Output:
Employee ID 101 removed successfully.

Test Case 6: Display All Employees
Input:
Display Employees
Expected Output:
ID: 102, Name: Bobby, Salary: 60000

Test Case 7: Adding Duplicate Employee ID
Input:
Add Employee (ID=101, Name="Charlie", Salary=70000)
Expected Output:
Error: Employee with ID 101 already exists.
